I want 10 examples for every option of the docker compose command
For every example, I want a user question related to this example

do not use the `docker-compose` command, use only the `docker compose` command

The output format will be a JSON array of objects, where each object has three fields: 
- `input`, 
- `instruction`, 
- and `output`. 

The `input` field will contain the user question, 
the `instruction` field will contain the instruction for the language model, the value is always "translate this sentence in docker command",
and the `output` field will contain the example of the docker build command.
